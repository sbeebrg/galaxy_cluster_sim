Source files for the setup of a galaxy cluster imaging model, to be used in ScopeSim_Templates.  
The cluster_setup.py file is responsible for generating physical parameters used to describe the positions and luminosity profiles of individual cluster galaxies.  
The clusters.py file uses these parameters in order to place SÃ©rsic Profile "stamps" on a blank canvas. It returns a ScopeSim Source object containing both an image HDU and an averaged spectrum.  
The CSV file containes a lookup table of per solar mass apparent magnitudes, necessary for obtaining galaxy magnitudes through stellar population synthesis.
